# verification-of-ALU-using-UVM


The objective of this project is to verify the functional correctness of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a SystemVerilog-based testbench. The ALU performs multiple arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and comparison based on a select control signal. A modular SystemVerilog testbench is developed using an interface to connect the DUT, along with stimulus generation to apply various input combinations covering all ALU operations.

The verification environment follows a self-checking methodology where the applied inputs and observed outputs are monitored and compared against expected results generated by a reference model. This approach ensures accurate detection of functional mismatches and corner-case issues. The verification setup improves confidence in the ALU design by validating correctness, robustness, and reliability before hardware implementation.
